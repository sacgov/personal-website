### Types of Learning
* Focused Learning
* Diffused Leaning

**_Focused_** learning is where we know the task in hand like adding 2 numbers. Our brains needn't think from a larger perspective. It activates parts of the brain that know how to process the task at hand. This doesn't need imagination or a broader perspective. Imagine Einstein sitting at his table in a small patent office working and speculating that the universe is constantly expanding. This requires a lot of effort and energy which brings us to the second type of learning.

**_Diffused_** learning is where we may have to come up with strategies. This is Innovation as we like to call it. We need to strategize around how we are approaching the task in hand. In this diffused mode of thinking, you can look at things broadly from a very different, broader perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can't focus as much as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem-solving or understand the finest aspects of a concept.

It seems like we can't be in both thinking modes at the same time. It's kind of like a coin. We can see either one side or the other side of the coin, but not both sides at the same time.

When we are learning something new, we should be able to go back and forth between the two types of thinking. That's what helps you learn effectively. We need to learn every day to flex our brains a bit and keep it in shape. A good analogy would be going to the gym every day to build muscles.

### What is learning?

We think the ability to do math and chess is amazing which requires years of training. We take for granted the abilities like seeing and running, balancing the center of gravity of our body. A very cheap computer can beat us in Math but even the fastest are not better than us at processing vision.

On a side note, Sleep is where the brain forms its most reliable connections. It is very important for its functioning at its highest possible configuration.

### Procrastination

It holds millions of people back. When we start a task that is painful to us it triggers the areas in the brain related to generating pain. This unease makes us shy away from the task.

**Pomodoro** Technique is setting a timer of 25 minutes and removing all interruptions between sessions. Almost anyone can focus for 25 minutes. Then make the brain happy for the remaining 5 minutes. This can be web surfing, calling your parents. Reward your brain after a brutal mental workout. It is the resting moment for the brain. 

When we feel an item, we touch its physical presence, hear or smell it. The brain can make sense of it. Math and science are more abstract and exist only in our heads and intangible. So this means we need more diffused learning to deal with them. Use Pomodoro to let diffused learning mode to kick and process ideas in the background in the free time after a session.

### Introduction to Memory

There are two types of Memory.
* Working Memory 
* Long-term memory

Working memory has to do with what we're immediately working on. It works out of the pre-frontal cortex. It holds about 4-7 chunks of information. We automatically chunk information so we can make up for the less space. Eg. We remember the phone number as 988-000-1234 in three chunks rather than 10 individual digits. We may close our eyes to prevent other items making their way into our working memory. It needs a bit of repetition to fit something here.

Short term memory is like an inefficient mental blackboard. The other form of memory, the long-term memory is like a data warehouse. It can have billions of items. So much so that some of it is buried deep inside. We need to practice a bit to get it out.

Long term memory is important as it is the one that stores the important information needed over the long term. Many new fundamental concepts we learn are committed to long term memory. This means we need to repeat stuff to get it registered there. To help we use *spaced repetition*.

**Spaced Repetition** is learning the same thing 1 time at a day for 20 days instead of 20 times a single evening. It is better to learn multiple things at once rather than focus on one and then move on to others if we can be disciplined enough.

### Importance of Sleep

The brain gets rid of a lot of toxins by increasing the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid at least in [mice](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep). The brain shrank in the mice to allow for better flow. Sleep also rehearses the things we want to remember better and strengthens the neural pattern. It's as if shutting the pre-frontal cortex responsible for the conscious us and allow the rest of the brain to coordinate better. Of course, you need to seed it first by reading some material with intense focus. It helps if it is in the evening or before we nap. Dreaming also helps and enhances learning and consolidating chunks according to some sources though I take this statement with a grain of salt.

### What is a Chunk?
When we learn something new, it is akin to a jumbled jigsaw puzzle. Chunking helps in putting a few of it together, though we don't know how these fit together.
When we are learning something with focus, our pre-frontal cortex juggles things in and out of the brain to the four chunks inside it, trying to make sense and chunks things together to assimilate more information into the 4 chunks. When we are _stressed_ we lose our ability to this well. When we are either angry, afraid, nervous, or stressed we lose this functionality.

A good analogy would be why we learn a language quickly if we are with people who speak it. We learn with focus - words from a book and then have diffused learning when we speak with others. It is much faster than learning only from books without conversing in it. 

A chunk is a network of neurons that fire together and know to do a task well. Focused practice and repetition can help build strong memory traces. Chunks are not all that is needed to become truly a master, but they help the brain with resources as we can ignore the underlying details relying on a chunk. Think of it like dressing, a single thought involving multiple operations like swirls of clothes, tucking your limbs.

### How to from a Chunk?

Every Learning is a tad different. Learning to dance is different compared to learning math. Chunking physical motions is not the same for History and Art. 
The _first_ step of chunking is to provide **undivided attention** to the task at hand. If we are running media in the background, looking up the social feed or mail means that our brain is having difficulty chunking. We have limited working memory and nothing should interfere with its process.
The _second_ step is to gain **understanding**. Be it anything that we are trying to learn, we can always grasp the gist of it if we allow the two modes of thinking to work together taking turns. Understanding is like that _super glue_ an encompassing memory trace that holds various other chunks together. You'd realize by now, this is how we create larger chunks. We shouldn't mistake _aha's_ in the class with true understanding. We often see that we understand something when we read it only to not know it in the future. Many times doing it ourselves, closing the book, and solving the math problem again is the key to mastery. Looking at some play chess, we understand the moves but true mastery is in playing it ourselves and win.

The _third_ step is **gaining context**, so we see not just how but also when and where we can use this chunk. Context means thinking broadly, compare it with previously assimilated information, repeating and practicing with unrelated and unrelated problems. This helps us see where this chunk fits into the bigger picture.  Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique.

Summing it up, chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context. Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you're
learning.

### Illusions of competence

One of the most common mistakes is to reread the material from a book or notes taken earlier. This approach is far less productive than _**recall**_. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read. Also better would be to do it at the end of spaced repetition at the end of today's session and the start of next day's session. Another great way is to draw concept maps to help understand and gain context of the chunk. Merely glancing at a solution and thinking we know it ourselves is an _Illusion of competence_.
Recall is a very powerful tool. Another tip is to change the area of study while recall. We often take in subliminal cues from the physical surroundings.

### What Motivates us?

It is hard to learn when you're not into it. But if it's something you're interested in, learning is easy. Why is that? Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how neurons respond to other neurons. They are _Acetylcholine, Dopamine and Serotonin._ 

Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity. Leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.

Dopamine neurons are part of a large brain system that controls reward learning and in particular in the basal ganglia, which is located in the green region above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex at the top of the brain. Dopamine is released from these neurons when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision-making. When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system. 

Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life. Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity. The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to risk-taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society. 


The value of a **library of chunks** is combining chunks to form innovations. Chess Masters can access thousands of patterns at once. Chunks can also help in newer topics. It is astounding to know that there are multiple chunks related to the fields we want to master. This is called *transfer*. The ribbon of chunks keeps getting stronger, the neurons denser and we a master of the trade. If we don't practice these chunks keep getting fainter with time.

### Overlearning, Einstellung, Interleaving
When we practice over and over again in the same study session it is  _overlearning_. It can have its place. It gives automaticity to the process. But it is not recommended in general. Even better would be to learn it again the next day. Otherwise, it can lead to wastage of precious learning time. 
We shouldn't learn the same thing again and again as we find it easy and rewarding that we know this. We need _deliberate practice_ every day focusing on the most difficult parts we want to achieve. Try to master the difficult stuff. It is like adding weights every day instead of doing the same weights for a year.
The German word _Einstellung_ means mindset. We need to change it at times and try thinking from a different perspective to deepen our understanding. This will also lead to unlearning the erroneous older ideas.
We shouldn't jump into the pool without learning how to swim. While we may somehow learn something, It is not optimal. I'm not a great typist. I'm not a hunt and peck typist either. But I'm not a great typist. That is because I just started coding without learning the ways of touch typing. My current method doesn't give me much scope to improve. Learn before you do hands-on as we can then have a certain context of what is going to happen.
**Interleaving** is very important. We can either cycle multiple unrelated subjects (say a Pomodoro session for a subject). This means we need more retrieval of information when we arrive at the subject again leading to a better understanding of the subject. It is more beneficial if the topics are related. From a coding perspective, I start building a project looking up things I need on google, while also learning the language or concepts from a book/tutorial. Mind that interleaving should not lead to switching subjects as soon as we encounter difficult material. Having a fixed time for each session helps mitigate this issue. Instead, we should persist in one subject until they have a sense of accomplishment before moving on to another subject.

### Introduction to Procrastination and Memory
Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is difficult to come by. It is not appropriate to spend willpower on fending off procrastination. Procrastination is akin to an addiction, offering temporary relief excitement and taking us away from the boring reality. We also sometimes go ahead and tell ourselves irrational reasons like, I was always bad at maths.
When we do everyday tasks, our brain goes into a _zombie_ mode where it does tasks without bothering with the minor details though they are taken care of but just not in the working memory. This is **Habit**.

A habit has a _cue_, that triggers it. Passing by a food joint, seeing a vehicle rushing towards us all are cues. _Routine_ is going into the shop and eating junk and dodging the vehicle._Reward_ is the immediate feeling of relief and pleasure. There is another one _belief_, which is a notion we have that we cannot change our habits.

**Process** vs **Product** is important to know here. Process means that I will do a Pomodoro session on learning chess. Product means I want to be a ChessMaster. It is important to focus on the process as it is easier and enforces a habit rather than the product.

Cues are mostly dependant on 
* Time
* Location
* Feelings
* Reaction to other people's words

We need to change our response to these cues. Do not eat that favorite snack as you by it on the way back home. Altering the habit drastically requires a lot of willpower and not recommended. We may feel like we have a lot of willpower. Even if that is the case it is still beneficial to use it sparingly. Rewire the brain to slowly alter the behavior. As we get better, the activity starts getting better.

_Time after time, those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill_.

Set a quitting time and write your task the night before to be clear and have more odds of finishing the tasks. Start with the most unpleasant task right off the morning.

A final checklist
* Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work.
* Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
* Write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success.
* Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.
* Always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards.
* Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes.
* Deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task.
* Watch for procrastination cues. Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library.
* Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you relax without feelings of guilt or worry.
* Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one’s perfect after all.
* Eat your frogs first every day. Happy experimenting.

**Physical Exercise** might just be the best thing we can do to our bodies to increase cognitive abilities. It helps all the body in general but usually, people do not know it significantly improves brain activity too.
