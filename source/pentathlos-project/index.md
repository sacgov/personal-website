## What is Pentathlos?

I will be trying a series of experiments on myself to alter my behaviour and habits to achieve my goals of a healthy, productive life. This is a self-improvment undertaking by me. I intend to journal my findings, relevant literature, thoughts and keep track of my improvements. I wanted an everyday chore to reflect on the effectiveness of experiments. Journalling on this blog was one that stuck my mind.

I tried a lot to become fit. I knew what to do to become fit. But i just couldn't force myself to follow a strict regimen. It dawned upon me that i am simply not motivated enough to become fit. It was not the top of my priorities but a healthy life is a precursor to all other goals. I am very curious about everything. Trying an experiment on myself would motivate me more than anything else. It would give me a renewed sense of ownership in my otherwise mundane life.

## Why the name Pentathlos?
Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a Greek polymath: a mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He is a great personal source of inspiration to me. His [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_Earth's_circumference)  to find the earth's circumference astounded me when i first read about it in my high school.


His critics scorned him, calling him Beta (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavours. Nonetheless, his devotees nicknamed him **Pentathlos** after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Eratosthenes yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.


I think that being [T-shaped](https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) has its advantages. It signifies the curiousity in a person. Each person has his vocation. For me it is coding and i yearn to be the absolute best at it. I totally relate to erathosthenes' goal of unravelling the mysteries of the entire world.


## What's in a name?


Symbols mean a lot to humans. They have the power to influence the behaviour significantly. Making it interesting would nudge me to work on it better.
