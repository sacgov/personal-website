## What is Pentathlos?

> Know thyself <br>
> \- ancient greek proverb.

I will be trying a series of experiments on myself altering my habits to achieve my goals of a healthy, happy and productive life. I intend to journal my findings, relevant literature, thoughts and the effectiveness of experiments. This is also to understand my motvators and decipher my ambitions.

Trying an experiment on myself would make gamify my life. Every day is a fun activty exploring the world. Who doesn't love a live action role-playing game. 

## Why the name Pentathlos?
Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a Greek polymath: a mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He is a great personal source of inspiration to me. His [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_Earth's_circumference) to find the earth's circumference astounded me when i first read about it in my high school.


His critics scorned him, calling him Beta (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavours. Nonetheless, his followers nicknamed him **Pentathlos** after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Eratosthenes yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.


I think that being [T-shaped](https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) has its advantages. It signifies the curiosity in a person. Each person has his vocation. For me it is coding and i yearn to be the absolute best at it. I totally relate to erathosthenes' goal of unravelling the mysteries of the entire world.


## What's in a name?

Symbols mean a lot to humans. They have the power to influence the behaviour significantly. Making it interesting would nudge me to work on it better.
